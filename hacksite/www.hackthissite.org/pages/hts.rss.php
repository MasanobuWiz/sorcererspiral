		<title>NEW! HackThisSite Project Incubator</title>
		<link><![CDATA[http://hackthissite.org/news/view/713]]></link>
		<guid><![CDATA[http://hackthissite.org/news/view/713]]></guid>
		<description><![CDATA[We often have a lot of community members asking about contributing content (namely code), but not wanting to become full staff members.  Well, we now have a solution for that!<br />
<br />
We have opened up a new part of HackThisSite called the [url=<a href="https://pi.hackthissite.org]<b>Project" target="_blank">https://pi.hackthissite.org]<b>Project</a> Incubator</b>[/url], or PI for short, where community members can now, whenever they want, incubate new HackThisSite projects (e.g. new missions, new ideas, etc.) that may either become fully managed HackThisSite services, or may even eventually make their way to our <a href="https://github.com/HackThisCode" target="_blank">public Github</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://pi.hackthissite.org" target="_blank">Check out the HackThisSite Project Incubator today!</a><br />
<br />
Happy hacking!]]></description>

This is a bit of a short notice!! It has been a few weeks since we last competed and we do not want to get rusty. This is another perfect opportunity for you to join in and get your feet wet on CTFs if you have never participated before.<br />
<br />
Team sizes can be up to 5 members. However, if you wish to join in with the HTS Team we will provide you with the necessary details to be sure we can all stay together. If you want to join us, hop into #CTF on IRC. While we primarily use IRC to communicate we do have a discord server available for voice comms.<br />
